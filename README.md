CrocoDS
=======

Amstrad emulator for Nintendo DS.

Based on Win-CPC by Ludovic Deplanque.

First version of CrocoDS was created for... Nintendo DS. 

How to install?
===============

- To run homebrews on your Nintendo DS, you need to buy a special DS cartridge (linker) to plug into your Nintendo DS game port. This cartridge is like a game cartridge except you insert a Flash card into it.
- First, connect the Flash card to your computer (using a Flash card reader) 
- Patch the .nds file with dldi if needed (http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/)
- Copy the homebrew file (the .nds file) from the computer to the flash card. 
- Copy the .dsk (or .sna) file in the root (or in the /ROMS/CPC directory) of your flash card).
- Then, get the Flash card and insert it into the special cartridge (linker). 
- Finally, plug this cartridge into your DS. That's all. 
- Switch on your DS and you will see a menu with the name of the homebrew file you've just transfered. Select it to run.     

How to use?
===========
    
- Direction PAD & A/B: Joystick, keypad or keyboard emulation. 
- SELECT to display the setup menu.
- To load a ROM, just press 'Select' to display the menu. Select the game and play.
